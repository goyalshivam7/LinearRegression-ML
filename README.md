# LinearRegression-ML

**Stock Price Prediction**:
I have added a quandl dataset of Amazon stock to predict data. And added a new column in this dataset for Prediction i.e ‘y’.

Then Using sklearn.model_selection i have splitted the data in the training set and test set.

Now use from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression to train data by using linear Regression. And after training I have used a prediction method to predict y_test data. And after prediction compared the y_pred and y_test.
Then find the Accuracy of prediction i.e. 98.9% in this case.
